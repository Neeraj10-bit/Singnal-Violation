# Singnal-Violation
Smart Signal is an innovative intelligent system designed to detect and identify traffic signal violators. 
This system leverages the power of  YOLO V8, a versatile and compact computing platform, to monitor traffic signals and identify vehicles that violate red lights or other traffic rules.
 The Smart Signal system is equipped with cameras and sensors that capture real-time traffic data, including vehicle speed, license plate numbers, and signal timing.
The system uses image processing and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect violations. 
When a vehicle runs a red light, the Smart Signal system automatically captures an image or video of the vehicle and its license plate. 
This data is then processed and stored, allowing for easy identification of the violator.
